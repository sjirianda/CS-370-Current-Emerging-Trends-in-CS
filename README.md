## What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
For Project 2, I was provided with base code to initialize the agent and environment. I implemented the logic inside the main loop of the application, specifically the decision-making process that allowed the agent to choose between exploration and exploitation strategies. This core functionality was written entirely by me and served as the foundation of the agentâ€™s behavior.
# Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists solve complex problems by designing algorithms, writing efficient code, and leveraging data to build intelligent systems.  Their work is essential to solving global challenges and improving quality of life through technology.
## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
My approach begins with forming a hypothesis about how to solve the problem, then testing and refining it. In computer science, this often translates into designing, implementing, and iterating on algorithms that address a specific challenge or task.
## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities include maintaining transparency and fairness, especially in the context of machine learning. This means addressing potential biases, ensuring the integrity of the models, and openly disclosing the sources of training data to build trust and accountability with both users and stakeholders.
